# Kmeans-Classifier-from-Scratch-Iris-Dataset
Implementing the kmeans algorithm to classify flowers from the Iris data set.

## Iris Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set which consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris. The variables measured for each sample are: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The combination of these four features is sufficient to develope a model for distinguishing the species from each other. The dataset was obtained from the scikit-learn library. It is accessible on the following website: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html

## Implementation of Kmeans
The Kmeans algorithm consists of two main parts.
